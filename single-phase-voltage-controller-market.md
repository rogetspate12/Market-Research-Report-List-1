<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Phase Voltage Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Phase Half-wave Voltage Controller</li><li>Single-Phase Full-wave Voltage Controller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The single-phase voltage controller market consists primarily of two types: single-phase half-wave voltage controllers and single-phase full-wave voltage controllers. Half-wave controllers manage voltage by allowing only one half of the AC waveform to pass, which is efficient for low-power applications but can lead to higher harmonic distortion. In contrast, full-wave controllers utilize both halves of the AC waveform, providing better voltage regulation and efficiency, making them suitable for a wider range of applications, including industrial and household uses.</p></p>
