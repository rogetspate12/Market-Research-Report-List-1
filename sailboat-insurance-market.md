<p><ul><li>Actual Cash Value</li><li>Agreed Amount Value</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sailboat insurance typically offers two market types: Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Agreed Amount Value (AAV). ACV insurance compensates for the boatâ€™s depreciated value at the time of loss, considering factors like age and wear. Conversely, AAV insurance allows owners to pre-determine the boat's value, ensuring a fixed payout in case of a total loss, regardless of depreciation. This distinction helps boat owners choose a policy that aligns with their financial needs and the boat's worth.</p></p>
