<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Powered Truck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Truck</li><li>LNG Truck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The natural gas-powered truck market primarily comprises two types: CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) trucks and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) trucks. CNG trucks store compressed natural gas in high-pressure tanks, making them suitable for shorter routes and urban applications. In contrast, LNG trucks utilize liquefied natural gas, which is stored at extremely low temperatures, allowing for greater energy density and longer-range capabilities, ideal for long-haul transport. Both options provide cleaner alternatives to traditional diesel trucks, reducing emissions and fuel costs.</p></p>
